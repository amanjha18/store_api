        <p>The instructions a programmer writes when creating a program. Lines of code are the "source code" of the program, and one line may generate one machine instruction or several depending on the programming language. A line of code in assembly language is typically converted into one machine instruction. </p>
        <p>Coding is how humans are able to talk with computers. Coding involves communicating and giving instructions for different actions we want our computers to perform using a computer programming language. Programming languages, like JavaSctipt, Java, C/C++, or Python, act as the translator between humans and machines.</p>
